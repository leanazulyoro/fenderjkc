# [Fender Jaguar Kurt Cobain](https://leanazulyoro.github.io/fenderjkc)
A website tribute to the Fender Jaguar Kurt Cobain edition electric guitar.

I uploaded it as part of my Graphic Designer portfolio, and intent to upgrade 
it with newer technologies to share also as a web developer portfolio.

## Roadmap:
I plan to build this website with a variety of frameworks, among them:
1. React.js
2. Angular
3. Vue.js

Also will be working on a dynamic data source for media and content in the site, I plan to build a GraphQL api
and maybe use so noSQL database.
